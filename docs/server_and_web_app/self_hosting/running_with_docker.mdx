## Running it locally
To run server locally you should be fine just with running simple docker image with mounted data volume. By default
Tolgee is using H2 database to store the data so you don't need another database to run it.

```
docker run -v tolgee_data:/data/ -p 8085:8080 \
-e tolgee.authentication.enabled=false \
tolgee/tolgee
```

This will:
 - mount tolgee_db image into it's directory inside the container
 - exposes tolgee container port on port 8085
 - disables authentication
 - runs the image!

Now you should be able to access Tolgee web application on [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085)

## Running with compose
To run it on company infrastructure it is better to use some more optimized database system. Tolgee supports PostgreSQL.
You can run it using docker-compose.
To start let's create and enter a folder to store Tolgee related files:
```
mkdir tolgee && cd tolgee
```

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` containing following content.
```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:11
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
  app:
    image: tolgee/tolgee
    volumes:
     - ./data:/data
    ports:
      - "8090:8080"
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - "db"
```

To provide a configuration, add following .env file.
```properties title=".env"
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/postgres
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
```
Similarly, you can define other [configuration properties](configuration).

Your initial username is `admin`. Initial password is automatically generated and stored in /data/initial.pwd file in the
Tolgee container. You can print it by executing this:
```
cat data/initial.pwd
```

The is now accessible on [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090).
