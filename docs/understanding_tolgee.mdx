To work with Tolgee properly you should be familiar with basic Tolgee concepts.

## Modes

Tolgee works in two modes: development and production.

### Development mode
Users, who access the page are able to change localization text in-context in development mode. To achieve this, Tolgee
needs to identify which text in [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
should be translated. Tolgee basically checks specific DOM subtree on every change and looks for translations keys
wrapped in strings provided by configuration properties `inputPrefix` and `inputSuffix`. This is the reason why wrapped keys
and params are returned from `translate` and `instant` functions in development mode.

### Production mode
On the contrary in production mode, `translate` and `instant` methods return the translated text directly.
Tolgee is unable to change the occurrences anymore. When language changes, you should
rerender every translated text manually. However, our integrations for React and Angular handle this out of the box.

## Key and parameters wrapping

In development mode Tolgee wraps every key and it's params into a specific format unless noWrap parameter is true.
```
<inputPrefix><translationKey>:[<param1>:<value1>,...,,<paramN>:<valueN>]<inputSuffix>
```

For example:
```javascript
tolgee.instant("peter_has_n_dogs", {dogsCount: "5"});
```
returns
```
%-%tolgee:peter_has_n_dogs:dogsCount:5%-%
```
when `inputPrefix` and `inputSuffix` configuration properties are default.

Tolgee is then able to find this wrapped string in DOM and replace it with `Peter has 5 dogs`. It also stores
its metadata in suitable parent element and makes it clickable to allow in-context localization.
